# Dictionary
A simple dictionary of words implemented with python using CLI.

An app where user can try to find the meanings to words, like in a dictionary. The words and its meanings are stored in a JSON file. Used the difflib library and its get_close_matches helper to find closest word to the user input if the user input is incorrect. Finds the meaning even if the input is uppercase or lowercase or a mixture of both.
